# SpringMVCFilmCRUD

## Description

This application was built to facilitace UI with the DVID sql database. It utilizes Gradle interact with the base code and push it to a tomcat local server. The application allows a user to:

- Search Films by Id
- Search Films by Keyword
- Search Actors by Id 
- Add an Actor
- Add a Film 
- Edit and exitsing film 
- Delete and actor
- Delete a Film
- 

Special attention was paid to formating user input in order to catch and eliminate errors. There is a robust Error catch structure with an error page feature that displays a user message and the actual error message aswell.

## Project Goals 

1. We wanted to especially focuss on the data types for UI and ensure that each value was self explanatory and would direct users accordingly. 
2. Enable team members extensive experience at stress testing for UI.UX issues and solving those problems.
3. Exceed all program requirments while maintaing "dry" readable code.

## Lessons Learned

One of tha largest lesson we learned was trouble shooting STS and Gradle interface when collaberating through git hub. We both ran into issues where serve functionality wasn't working after a Git Pull. In addition the methods in way were intially cathing error was refactored to maje the code more readable. We found that many time more verbous was ket to readability and room for future developement.
